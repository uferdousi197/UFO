# UFO
In this module we create an interactive webpage and a dynamic table with multiple filters using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Overview
This projects provides a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:
The table below shows a preview of how the search is performed to filter the results of UFO sightings.

One drawback of this webpage is that it contains a filter by country when the only country listed is US.
Two recommendations for further development would be to get rid of the country column and search filter as it is all within the United States.
Another recommendation would be to capitalize city names and or state abbreviation and allow search filter to sort in that manner.
